He is said to intercede on behalf of gamblers, so they can make big bets without fear of losing.</p>
<p>It is said that Damian was a soldier who won a large amount of money in a dice game. When he went to collect his winnings, the owner refused to pay him, saying that the game was rigged. Damian protested and said that if it was rigged, then he would have never won in the first place. The owner was so impressed with Damian’s integrity that he paid him double what he had won.</p>
