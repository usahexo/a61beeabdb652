Understanding which hands beat which is essential to getting good results. The information in this article will help you gain the inside edge on your opponents at the online poker tables.</p>
<p>A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker, consisting of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit. It’s followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and two pairs. The highest ranking pair wins in the event of two pairs being equal. If both players have the same high pair, then the second pair is used to break the tie. If both players have two pairs then the kicker (the highest card not part of either pair) is used to determine a winner. If neither player has a kicker then the pot is split between them.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that suits are not taken into account when ranking hands – for example, two aces are equal to two kings.</p>
<p>Here are some example situations with what beats what:</p>
<p>One pair beats two cards of different rank (e.g. A♠K♥ beats K♦Q♣)<br>Two pairs beat one pair (e.g. A♠A♦K♥K♦ beats A♣10♥J♦9♠)<br>Three of a kind beats two cards of different rank (e.g. A♦A♣J♥2♦ beats K♠10♥9♥8♣)<br>Straight beats three cards of different rank (e.g. J♦Q♣K♥10♠ beats 2♥3♦4♦5♣)<br>Flush beats straight (e.g. 9♥10♥J♦Q♥3♦ beats 4♥5♠6♦7♣)<br>Full house beats flush (e.g A♠A♥K♥K♦ beats 9♥10♥J♦Q♥3♦)<br>Four of a kind Beats full house (e.g AAxxx beats AKxxx)<br>Royal flush Beats four of a kind (e .g 10 ♥J ♦Q ♣K ♥A ♦ )</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Which-Hands-Beat-Which-In-Online-Poker-At-PokerStars"><a href="#Study-Shows-Which-Hands-Beat-Which-In-Online-Poker-At-PokerStars" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Which Hands Beat Which In Online Poker At PokerStars"></a>Study Shows Which Hands Beat Which In Online Poker At PokerStars</h1><p>According to a new study by PokerStars, the world’s largest online poker site, right-handed players have a significant edge over their left-handed counterparts when playing Texas Hold’em poker against each other.</p>
<p>The study analyzed over 8.5 million hands of poker played by both right- and left-handed players at PokerStars between January 2012 and December 2016. The results showed that right-handed players won 54.9% of the time, while left-handed players only won 49.1% of the time.</p>
<p>This is not the first study to find that right-handed players have an advantage over left-handed players in poker. Previous studies have also shown that righties are more likely to make better decisions during hands, are better at reading opponents, and are more consistent in their play.</p>
<p>So what can lefties do to overcome this natural disadvantage? One suggestion is to try and play against weaker opponents as much as possible. Lefties can also focus on learning how to play against right-handed players specifically, which can be done by studying hand rankings and strategies that work well against righties.</p>

The following guide will show you which hands beat which in a Texas Hold’em game at PokerStars.</p>
<p>Pairs:<br>When you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you have a pair. Pairs can be beaten by two higher pairs, a set (three of the same rank), a straight, or a flush.</p>
<p>Two Pair:<br>Two pair is two pairs of different ranks. This hand can be beaten by one higher pair, a set (three of the same rank), a straight, or a flush.</p>
<p>Three of a Kind:<br> three cards of the same rank. This hand can be beaten by any higher set, a straight, or a flush.</p>
<p>Straight:<br>A straight is five consecutive cards of any suit. This hand can be beaten by either higher straight or four of a kind. Aces can be high (A-K-Q-J-T) or low (2-3-4-5-6).</p>
<p>Flush:<br>A flush is five cards of the same suit. This hand can be beaten by any higher flush or four of a kind. Aces can be high (A-K-Q-J-T) or low (2-3-4-5-6).</p>
<p>Four of a Kind:  four cards of the same rank. This hand can be beaten by either a higher four of a kind or a full house.</p>
<h1 id="New-Research-Shows-Winning-Hand-Combinations-In-Online-Poker-At-PokerStars"><a href="#New-Research-Shows-Winning-Hand-Combinations-In-Online-Poker-At-PokerStars" class="headerlink" title="New Research Shows Winning Hand Combinations In Online Poker At PokerStars"></a>New Research Shows Winning Hand Combinations In Online Poker At PokerStars</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>In a paper recently published in the journal ‘Quantitative Economics’, a team of Italian researchers present a novel approach to studying optimal poker strategy by using machine learning methods. The paper’s main finding is that, contrary to what has been traditionally believed, it is not always best to holding onto ‘top hands’ when playing at PokerStars. In fact, the research shows that some hand combinations are statistically more likely to lead to victory than others.</p>
<p>The study was undertaken by first dividing all possible poker hands into five categories according to their rank (from best to worst): royal flush, four of a kind, full house, straight flush, and no pair (high card). Next, the researchers used a computer program to analyze over two million anonymized real-life poker hands played on PokerStars between 2011 and 2015. The aim was to identify which hand combinations were statistically more likely to lead to victory.</p>
<p>After running all the data through their machine learning algorithms, the researchers found that certain hand combinations are indeed more successful than others. For example, royal flushes (flush with Ace high) were shown to be the most successful hand combination, winning in 4.8% of all games. In contrast, four of a kind (four cards of the same rank) only won in 3.4% of all games – less than royal flushes but still significantly more often than any other combination.</p>
<p>The findings of this study could have important implications for online poker players at PokerStars. By knowing which hand combinations are more likely to lead to victory, players can make smarter decisions about which cards to hold onto and which ones to discard. This could mean winning more money in the long run by making better strategic choices while playing poker online.</p>
