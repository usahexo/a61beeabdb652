The game companies put a lot of thought into how the dice will be used.<br>When it comes to casino games, there is no more important tool than the dice. They are used in games like craps, roulette and even slots. So, it’s no surprise that game companies take their time in designing the perfect casino dice.</p>
<p>Krakatoa Games has been in the business of designing casino games for over 15 years. During that time, they have developed a patented process for making casino dice. This process has been refined over the years to ensure that the dice are perfect for gaming purposes.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of Krakatoa’s process is making sure each side of the die has an equal chance of landing on top. To do this, they use a specially designed machine to roll each die. This machine ensures that each side is hit with the same amount of force, giving each side an equal chance of landing face up. </p>
<p>In addition to ensuring fairness, this process also creates a more durable die. By hitting each side with equal force, it spreads the wear and tear evenly across all sides. This makes the die less likely to show wear and tear over time. </p>
<p>Krakatoa Games has been supplying casinos around the world with quality casino dice for many years now. If you’re looking for a supplier of casino dice, be sure to check out Krakatoa Games!</p>

The process of how they make their casino dice is a closely-guarded secret, but we were able to get a glimpse into their workshop and see how they do it.</p>
<p>The first step is to select the right materials. They use a special blend of plastics and metals that are specifically designed for making casino dice. This helps them to create a product that is both durable and consistent.</p>
<p>Once the materials have been selected, the next step is to start shaping them. This is done with a series of high-precision machines that can create the perfect shape and size for each die.</p>
<p>After the dice have been shaped, they need to be polished. This is done with a series of diamond-tipped tools that remove any imperfections and give them a smooth finish.</p>
<p>The final step is to print the markings on the face of the die. This can be done in any number of different ways, depending on the design that is required. Once it has been printed, the die is ready for distribution to casinos all around the world.</p>

<li>To make casino dice, you need some basic equipment like a drill, a saw and a lathe. </li>
<li>You also need to find the right materials. Krakatoa uses mahogany lumber for its dice.</li>
<li>The first step is to drill the numbers into each die. The numbers are drilled in two stages. The first stage drills the outline of each number. The second stage drills the inside of each number.</li>
<li>The next step is to cut out each die using a band saw. A jigsaw can also be used but a band saw produces a cleaner cut.</li>
<li>The last step is to turn each die on a lathe. This step is optional but it gives the dice a nice finish and makes them more durable.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Step-by-step-guide-on-how-Krakatoa-Game-makes-casino-dice"><a href="#Step-by-step-guide-on-how-Krakatoa-Game-makes-casino-dice" class="headerlink" title="Step by step guide on how Krakatoa Game makes casino dice"></a>Step by step guide on how Krakatoa Game makes casino dice</h1><p>A Brief History of Casino Dice<br>Dice were originally used as a method to help in the calculation of military strategies. They were also employed as random number generators for gambling games such as dice, backgammon and craps. </p>
<p>The use of casino dice began in the 18th century, with the French and English playing a game known as Hazard. The game was eventually banned in both countries, but not before it had gained immense popularity. In America, casino dice games can be traced back to the early 1800s when they were played primarily in riverboats. Items such as ivory, bone and wood were commonly used to make casino dice until the 1930s when plastic began to be used.</p>
<p>How Casino Dice are Made<br>Today, casino dice are typically made out of acrylic or polycarbonate plastics. They are molded and then injected with silicone rubber letters that are then cured. The numbers on each die are either molded or engraved into the surface, depending on the type of die. Finally, the dice are polished and sometimes painted, with different colors used for different sides (e.g., red for dots and black for pips).</p>
<p>The manufacture of casino dice is a precise process that is overseen by experienced technicians. It begins with the selection of high-quality plastics that will be used to create the desired shape of each die. The mold is created using a CNC machine and must be extremely accurate so that the final product is consistent from die to die. </p>
<p>The injection process utilizes specialized equipment that forces silicone rubber into each mold at high pressure. This creates a positive impression of each letter on the surface of the die. After curing, the letters are sanded down until they are smooth and flush with the surface of the die. The numbers on each side of the die are then engraved or molded into the plastic, depending on their location. </p>
<p>Final assembly involves polishing all six sides of each die and applying paint if needed. The paint is generally translucent so that the original color of the plastic can be seen beneath it. Once inspection is complete, casino dice are ready for packing and shipping to casinos around the world!</p>

In this article, we’ll take a behind-the-scenes look at how they make their dice.</p>
<p>To start with, Krakatoa Game uses high-quality ABS plastic to make their dice. This gives them a nice weight and feel, and also ensures that the dice will be durable.</p>
<p>Next, the team at Krakatoa use a CNC machine to cut the dice out of the plastic sheet. This ensures that each die is cut perfectly, with no blemishes or defects.</p>
<p>The next step is to drill the pips into the top of each die. This is done by hand, and it’s a skilled job that takes years of practice to perfect.</p>
<p>After that, it’s time for the graphics. Krakatoa uses a high-resolution laser engraver to etch the graphics onto each die. This results in beautiful and accurate designs that are guaranteed to last for years.</p>
<p>Finally, the dice are packaged and shipped out to casinos all over the world. Thanks to the attention to detail paid by the team at Krakatoa Game, their casino dice are some of the best in the business.</p>
