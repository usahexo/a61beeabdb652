The book contains a variety of spells and curses, as well as prophecies about the future. It is said that anyone who reads the book will become cursed.</p>
<p>The Book of Loki was first mentioned in the 10th century Icelandic Saga of Hromundar Gripsson. According to the saga, Hromundar was given the book by his father, who had found it in a cave. Hromund decided to burn the book, but was unable to do so because it kept returning to him.</p>
<p>In modern times, the Book of Loki has gained notoriety for being associated with a number of dark events, including several murders and suicides. Some people believe that the book is cursed and can cause misfortune and death to those who come into contact with it.</p>
