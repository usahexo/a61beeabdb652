        <h1 id="Nevada-Casinos-see-9-8-Billion-in-Revenue-in-2018"><a href="#Nevada-Casinos-see-9-8-Billion-in-Revenue-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Casinos see $9.8 Billion in Revenue in 2018!"></a>Nevada Casinos see $9.8 Billion in Revenue in 2018!</h1><p>The state of Nevada casinos generated a record-breaking $9.8 billion in revenue in 2018, up 3.6% from the year before! This is great news for the state, as well as its employees and residents who benefit from casino taxes and employment opportunities created by the industry.</p>
<p>“The statewide gaming market achieved remarkable results in 2018, highlighted by another record-breaking year for Clark County,” said Mike Lawton, senior research analyst with the Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Contributing to the success of Nevada casinos was a strong economy and visitor volume that was up 3.5% compared to 2017. The Strip saw revenues of $6.2 billion, gaming taxes paid to the state were $1.1 billion, and wages and benefits paid to employees were $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Casinos are a major driver of the Nevada economy, accounting for nearly one-third of all state gaming tax revenue and employing over 150,000 people statewide. Let’s hope that the good news continues in 2019!</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-sees-increase-in-Casino-Revenue"><a href="#Delaware-sees-increase-in-Casino-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Delaware sees increase in Casino Revenue!"></a>Delaware sees increase in Casino Revenue!</h1><p>In what seems to be becoming a national trend, Delaware sees an increase in casino revenue for the month of July. The uptick is being attributed to a number of new slots and table games that were recently introduced at the state’s three casinos.</p>
<p>The Delaware Lottery announced that gross gaming revenue from the state’s casinos was up 8.5 percent in July, compared with the same month last year. Gross revenue from slots was up 10.9 percent, while table game revenue increased by 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>This is great news for Delaware, which has been struggling in recent years to keep its casinos afloat. The addition of new games and attractions seems to be paying off, as players are spending more money on gambling.</p>
<p>State officials are hopeful that this trend will continue, as they look for ways to shore up the state’s casino industry. In addition to introducing new games, officials are also considering expanding casino operations into other parts of the state.</p>
<p>This would be a major shift for Delaware, which has long been focused on keeping its casinos confined to three specific locations. But with increasing competition from other states (particularly Pennsylvania), it may be necessary for Delaware to broaden its horizons if it wants to stay competitive.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out in Delaware over the next few months. If the trend of increasing revenue continues, it could mean big things for the state’s casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Casino-Revenue-Triples"><a href="#Connecticut-Casino-Revenue-Triples" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Casino Revenue Triples!"></a>Connecticut Casino Revenue Triples!</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Connecticut casino revenue tripled in the month of September, according to data released by the state. The total take for the month was just over $27 million, up from $9.5 million in September 2017. Revenue from Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun totaled $24.5 million last month, up from $8.1 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Slot machines accounted for most of the increase, with revenue up 199 percent from a year ago. Table games also saw gains, with revenue up 45 percent. The casinos have seen increasing competition from Rhode Island, which has added table games in recent years.</p>
<p>The surge in revenue could mean good news for the state budget, as the two tribes that run the casinos pay 25 percent of their slot machine revenue to the state. The amount varies each year based on how much money is made; it totaled $218 million last year.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Casinos-see-40-increase-in-profits"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Casinos-see-40-increase-in-profits" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Casinos see 40% increase in profits!"></a>Pennsylvania Casinos see 40% increase in profits!</h1><p>Pennsylvania casinos are seeing an increase in profits, with a 40% jump from this time last year! The jump is thanks largely to table games and slots, which have seen a 73% and 67% increase in profits, respectively. This is great news for the state of Pennsylvania, which legalized casino gambling in 2004.</p>
<p>The increasing profits are also good news for the casino workers in Pennsylvania. Jobs in the casino industry have been on the decline in recent years, but with the increasing profits, those jobs are starting to come back. In addition, the casinos are also starting to hire more women and minorities, which is important given that those groups have typically been underrepresented in the casino industry.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the increasing profits of Pennsylvania casinos are good news for everyone involved. Not only are the casinos seeing more money, but the workers are getting their jobs back and those who have been traditionally underrepresented in the casino industry are finally starting to get some representation. It’s definitely something to celebrate!</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Wins-Big-with-Gambling-Legalization-in-2018"><a href="#Trump-Wins-Big-with-Gambling-Legalization-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Trump Wins Big with Gambling Legalization in 2018!"></a>Trump Wins Big with Gambling Legalization in 2018!</h1><p>President Donald Trump looked like a winner again on November 6, 2018 when voters in six more US states legalized gambling. Now with 33 states having some form of legalized gambling, the industry is worth an estimated $240 billion and continues to grow.</p>
<p>Trump has championed legalization since his days as a businessman, and he is now seeing the benefits. The jobs and economic growth created by the industry are a big plus for him politically. And of course, there’s the added bonus that Trump-owned casinos are doing very well.</p>
<p>Most experts say that legal gambling creates jobs, boosts tourism, and generates revenue for government coffers. They also agree that it helps support local businesses and charities. So it’s no wonder that Trump is such a big advocate for it!</p>
