#  5 Casino Games With the Lowest House Edge – Including Real Madrid Edition 

Casino games can be great fun and provide hours of entertainment, but there’s no denying that the house edge on many games is relatively high. This means that the casino has a mathematical advantage over the player, and in the long run, the casino will almost always come out on top.

However, there are a few casino games where the house edge is lower than average, meaning players have a better chance of winning in the long run. In this article, we take a look at five casino games with the lowest house edge.

Craps has a relatively high house edge compared to some other casino games – typically around 10%.
