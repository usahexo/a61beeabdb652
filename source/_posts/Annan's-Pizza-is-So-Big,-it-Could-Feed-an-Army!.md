#  Kofi Annan's Pizza is as big as a Medium Blackjack Pizza!

In honor of the life of Kofi Annan, I decided to order one of his favorite foods: pizza. And not just any pizza, but a giant Kofi Annan-sized blackjack pizza from Pizza Hut!

I was honestly quite skeptical that such a large pizza could actually fit in my oven, but it turns out that it does -- barely. The only downside is that there's no way to cook the pizza evenly, so the crust on the edge is really overcooked by the time the center is cooked.

But at least it's edible! And even if it's not as good as a regular small blackjack pizza, it's still pretty darn good. In fact, Kofi Annan himself would probably be pretty happy with a giant slice of this deliciousness.
