Red Rock Casino Roth Goes Offline
Las Vegas, NV. - Red Rock Casino Roth went offline for a reported system issue this morning. Slot machines stopped working, and card tables were devoid of players. Although the casino's website is still live, all social media accounts have been inactive since the outage.

The problem began at 7:00am, when several players took to Twitter to complain about the lack of service. "Red Rock Casino Roth is down AGAIN! This place is a joke," said one player. Another person tweeted a picture of an empty slot machine, commenting "Red Rock Casino Roth is having a bad day today."

An employee who asked not to be named told us that the problem was with the casino's "back-end systems." She said that she did not know when the problem would be fixed.

A spokesperson for Red Rock Casino Roth could not be reached for comment.
