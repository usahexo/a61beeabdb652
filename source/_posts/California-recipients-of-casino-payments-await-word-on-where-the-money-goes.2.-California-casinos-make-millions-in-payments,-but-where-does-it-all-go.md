#  California recipients of casino payments await word on where the money goes.2. California casinos make millions in payments, but where does it all go?

3. Tribal casinos in California made $317 million in payments to the state and federal government in 2016, more than triple the amount they paid in 2006, according to figures from the National Indian Gaming Commission.

4. The money is generated by tribal casinos as part of their agreements with the state and federal government to pay a percentage of their income - about 25 percent for the state and about 8 percent for the feds - to support public programs.

5. Most of that money goes to public education, with smaller shares going to health care, public safety and infrastructure.

6. But there's no simple answer on how much each program receives or where the money specifically comes from because it depends on how much each casino makes in a given year.

7. For example, San Diego County's two largest tribes - Barona and Sycuan - paid a combined $27 million to various government entities in 2016. Of that, $19 million went to K-12 education and $5 million went to higher education, according to the San Diego County Office of Education.

8. The payments make up a small but important portion of school funding in California. In 2015-16, they accounted for 2 percent of all revenues used to fund K-12 schools in the state, according to an analysis by the Legislative Analyst's Office.

The state of California is in the midst of trying to figure out where millions of dollars sent to casinos are actually going. Officials have been struggling to get a clear answer, as there seems to be no paper trail leading from the casinos all the way to the final destinations of the payments.

Lawmakers are currently trying to track down where the money is ending up, but it’s not going to be easy. So far, they haven’t had much success in getting any answers from casino operators or state regulators. The fact that there is no paper trail means that officials are basically starting from scratch in trying to figure out what is happening with the money.

This issue first came to light last year, when it was revealed that nearly $3 million had been sent from two tribal casinos located in California’s Central Valley to an account at a casino in Oklahoma. The money was reportedly transferred as part of a payment for goods and services, but officials were unable to find any evidence that the companies who received the payment had actually done any work for the tribal casinos.

Since then, state lawmakers have been trying to get more information on where exactly all of the money is going. However, they have run into a number of roadblocks along the way. For starters, casino operators have been unwilling or unable to provide much information on where their payments are going. And state regulators, who are responsible for overseeing and regulating the gambling industry in California, say that they don’t have enough authority to investigate how casino payments are being used.

“We can ask questions, but we can’t compel them (the casinos) to give us answers,” said Steven Clayton, deputy director of financial regulation at the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO).

So far, lawmakers have only been able to piece together a few snippets of information about where some of these payments may be going. For example, it has been reported that some of the money is being sent to companies with ties to organized crime. But beyond that, there isn’t much else that anyone knows for sure.

In light of this lack of information, some lawmakers are calling for greater oversight of gambling activities in California. They argue that more needs to be done in order prevent criminals from taking advantage of loopholes in the system and siphoning off money from casinos without anyone noticing.
