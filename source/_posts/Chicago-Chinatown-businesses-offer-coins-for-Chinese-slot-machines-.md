#  Chicago Chinatown businesses offer coins for Chinese slot machines 

A number of businesses in Chicago Chinatown are now offering coins as encouragement for people to play Chinese slot machines. The hope is that this will help gambling addicts in the area, and bring money into the community.

While gambling is technically illegal in China, it is still a popular pastime. This has led to the development of Chinese slot machines, which are unique in that they allow players to win back some of their money.

In order to promote these machines, business owners are giving out coins to players. The theory is that, if people can get a little bit of their money back, they will be more likely to continue playing.

This strategy seems to be working, as business owners report that more people are now playing the machines. In addition, the extra money brought in by these games is helping to boost the local economy.

#  San Francisco Chinatown business plentiful of coins for Chinese slot machines 

In the heart of San Francisco Chinatown, business is booming for operators of Chinese slot machines. While officials estimate that there are only about 200 of the machines in the city, business owners insist that their income from the games is a major contributor to their livelihood.

One such game, known as "pushers," involves players inserting coins into a machine in order to move tiles around on a board, in the hopes of creating a winning combination. Winners can take home anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $10,000 or more.

The thriving business in Chinatown is due, in part, to lax enforcement by local officials. Business owners simply need a permit to operate the machines, and there is no limit on how many can be installed. In addition, because the games are considered "amusement devices," it's not illegal for minors to play them.

Some residents and business owners would like to see tighter regulations on the machines, but others enjoy the extra income they generate. With business so brisk, it's unlikely that San Francisco's Chinatown will be without Chinese slot machines anytime soon.

#  Seattle residents hunt for coins necessary to play Chinese Slot machines 

Seattle has a new pastime - hunting for coins to play Chinese Slot machines. The slots are popular among Seattle's Asian community, who see the games as a way to make some money.

The machines, which can be found in many Seattle-area restaurants and grocery stores, work like this: players buy a certain number of coins, which they then feed into the machine. Each coin buys them a certain number of chances to win prizes.

The prizes include small amounts of money, gift cards, and other prizes. But the biggest draw for many people is the possibility of winning cash prizes. In fact, some people are so attracted to the machines that they will go out of their way to find them in order to play.

One Seattle resident said that she enjoys playing the machines because they offer a chance to win something big without having to risk too much money. She added that she has won several small gift cards from playing the machines.

Not everyone is happy with the new trend, however. Some business owners in Seattle complain that the machines are noisy and attract unsavory characters who create a disturbance in their establishments. They would like to see them removed from their businesses altogether.

Whether or not the machines stay in Seattle-area businesses remains to be seen, but it seems likely that they will continue to be popular among those looking for a chance to win some extra money.
