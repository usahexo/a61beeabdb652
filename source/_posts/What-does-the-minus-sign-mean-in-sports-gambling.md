#  What does the minus sign mean in sports gambling?

When you see a minus sign in front of a team's point spread, that means the team is the favorite. The number after the minus sign is how many points that team is favored by. For example, if the Seahawks are playing the 49ers and the line reads -10.5, that means Seattle is favored by 10.5 points. If you bet on Seattle, they would have to win by 11 or more points for you to win your bet. If you bet on San Francisco, they could lose by up to 10 points and you would still win your bet.

#  How to bet on basketball with the plus and minus sign

So you’re looking to bet on some basketball games but don’t know how to read the point spread? In this article we will explain how to use the plus and minus sign when betting on basketball.

The point spread is a way for sportsbooks to even out the odds on both teams. They do this by giving one team a head start, or disadvantage, in the game. The point spread is represented as a number preceded by either a plus or minus sign.

For example, if the Lakers are playing the Celtics and the point spread is -5, it means that the Celtics are favored by 5 points. This means that Celtics bettors would have to risk $5 for every $10 they want to win, while Lakers bettors would only have to risk $4 for every $10 they want to win.

Conversely, if the point spread was +5, it would mean that the Lakers were favored by 5 points. In this case Celtics bettors would only have to risked $1 for every $10 they want to win, while Lakers bettors would have to risk $6 for every $10 they want to win.

Now that you understand how to read the point spread let’s take a look at how you can use it when betting on basketball games. Most sportsbooks will allow you to place bets both against the spread (ATS) and on the moneyline.

When betting against the spread you are trying to pick a team that will lose by fewer points than the point spread indicates. For example, if you think that the Lakers will beat the Celtics by less than 5 points then you would wager on the Lakers ATS. Conversely, if you think that the Celtics will beat the Lakers by more than 5 points then you would wager on them ATS.

When betting on the moneyline you are simply trying to pick a winner. So if you think that the Lakers will beat the Celtics outright then you would wager on them moneyline. Similarly, if you think that the Celtics will lose outright then you would wager on them moneyline.

#  What is the difference between a plus and minus in sports gambling?

When gambling on sports, there are two types of bets you can make - the plus and minus.

The difference between a plus and minus is that a plus is when you bet that the team will win by more than the point spread, while a minus is when you bet that the team will lose by more than the point spread.

For example, if the Packers are playing the Bears and the point spread is 10 points, then a person who bets on the Packers would have to bet $11 to win $10 (because they would be betting that Green Bay wins by more than 10 points). A person who bets on the Bears would have to bet $1 to win $10 (because they would be betting that Chicago loses by more than 10 points).

So, in short, a plus is when you bet that the team will win by more than the spread, while a minus is when you bet that the team will lose by more than the spread.

#  How to use the plus and minus in sports betting

If you're new to sports betting, you may be wondering what the plus and minus sign next to each team's odds mean. The plus and minus (or "spread" as it's known in the US) indicate how much one side is favoured over the other.

For example, if Everton are playing Manchester City and the spread is set at +2 for Everton, this means that Manchester City are 2 goals favourite over Everton. So if you were to bet on Everton, they would need to win or draw the game for you to make a profit. If Manchester City won by 3 or more goals, your bet would lose even if Everton had scored 2 or more goals.

Conversely, if the spread was set at -2 for Manchester City, this would mean that Everton were 2 goal underdogs. So if you were to bet on Manchester City, they would need to win by at least 3 goals for you to make a profit (or 2 goals if you bet on them and they win by exactly 1 goal). If Everton won, your bet would still lose even if Manchester City only scored one goal.

The point of a sports spread is to give an equal chance of winning money on either side of a wager, regardless of who wins the game. This makes it a popular option for those who don't know which team will come out on top.

#  What is the purpose of the plus and minus in basketball gambling?
