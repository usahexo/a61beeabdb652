Future-forward helmet designers are always looking for new and inventive ways to protect the head. At times this leads to some rather amusing outcomes, as in the case of the soaring novelty helmet. This bizarre innovation is exactly what it sounds like: a helmet with wings that allow the wearer to fly. The idea behind it is that you can use the extra mobility to escape danger or take shortcuts in your everyday life.

While the concept may seem outlandish, there is actually a fair bit of science behind it. The lifting force generated by a pair of wings is enough to keep even a large person in the air, as long as they are flying slowly enough. And since modern helmets are already quite light, there is no real downside to incorporating wings into their design.

There have been several prototypes of the soaring novelty helmet created over the years, but none has managed to gain much traction in the market. This may be partly due to its high price point, but also because of its inherent impracticality. After all, who wants to wear a cumbersome helmet every time they leave the house?

Despite its shortcomings, the soaring novelty helmet provides an interesting glimpse into the future of head protection. It's likely that we will see more and more adventurous designs in this area in the years to come. So if you're ever feeling daring, why not give one a try?
