#  Illinois Gambling Ban Upheld by Federal Appeals Court

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Tuesday upheld a law banning most forms of gambling in Illinois, dealing a blow to the state’s estimated $2 billion industry.

The Indiana-based court ruled that the 2011 law does not violate the constitutional rights of gamblers or the companies that operate the state’s casinos and horse racing tracks.

Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said she was pleased with the ruling, which “affirms the state’s authority to restrict gambling in order to protect Illinois citizens and taxpayers.”

The lawsuit was brought by two horse racing tracks, a casino company and several players who argued that the law violated their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. They also contended it amounted to an unconstitutional prohibition on gambling.

But the three-judge appeals court panel disagreed, saying that while gambling is a constitutionally protected activity, Illinois has a right to regulate it.

#  Illinois Gambling Ban Remains in Place After Court Ruling

On Wednesday, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the state's gambling ban is constitutional.

The unanimous decision upheld a lower court ruling from last year, finding that the ban does not violate the rights of citizens. The plaintiffs in the case, a group of casino owners and operators, had argued that the ban interfered with their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.

Illinois has been one of just a handful of states with a complete gambling ban, which outlaws everything from casinos and poker rooms to betting on horse races. The state has been debating whether to repeal or amend the ban for years, but Wednesday's ruling means that it will likely remain in place for the foreseeable future.

Even if the state were to repeal or amend the ban, it would still be subject to federal law, which prohibits most forms of gambling across the country.

#  Illinois Gambling Ban Upheld for Another Year

Despite a recent court case that could have overturned the statewide ban on gambling, Illinois’s Supreme Court has upheld the prohibition for another year. The unanimous decision comes as a relief to many who were concerned that legalizing gambling would result in an increase in crime and social ills.

While some argue that the state is missing out on valuable revenue by not legalizing gambling, others are happy to see the ban remain in place. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for those who can least afford it. Additionally, gambling can create social problems like crime and compulsive spending.

Supporters of the ban argue that Illinois is better off without legalized gambling. They maintain that the state should focus on more important issues like education and infrastructure. There is also concern that if gambling is legalized, the big casinos will take over and put small businesses out of business.

It remains to be seen whether or not Illinois will eventually legalize gambling. In the meantime, the state’s gaming ban will stay in effect.

#  Seventh Circuit Upholds Illinois Gambling Ban

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court’s ruling that the Illinois gambling ban is constitutional. The decision came in response to a lawsuit brought by several casino operators in the state, who argued that the prohibition on gambling was unconstitutional.

In its decision, the Seventh Circuit found that the gambling ban served a legitimate purpose in stopping organized crime from gaining a foothold in the Illinois gaming industry. The court also noted that the ban did not infringe on the constitutional rights of casino operators or patrons.

The decision is a blow to casino operators in Illinois, who had been hoping for a more favorable ruling from the Seventh Circuit. It remains to be seen whether they will appeal to the US Supreme Court.

#  Federal Appeals Court Upholds Illinois Gambling Ban

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a law in Illinois that bans most forms of gambling. The law, which was passed in 1939, prohibits most types of gambling, including casino gaming, horse racing, and lottery tickets.

The plaintiffs in the case, who are all Illinois residents, argued that the law is unconstitutional. They claimed that the ban on gambling violates their right to freedom of expression and their right to pursue happiness.

However, the court ruled that the law is constitutional. In its decision, the court noted that the ban on gambling serves a “compelling interest” in protectng public morals and preventing crime.

The plaintiffs have said they plan to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
